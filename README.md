# monty-python-holygrail-hangman

**A Terminal Monty Python themed hangman game**

This is a fun hangman like game to guess quotes from the Monty Python movie,
The quest for the holy grail. Your aim is to guess the quote by guessing the letters
one at a time. You have 5 chances (or 3 changes if you claim you are an expert)
to guess the quote and if not, as the Black knight loses one limb after another,
your champion will also lose.

The quotes were web scrapped from montypython.net and then modified and added
some extra. The approach is captured in mp_quote_list_gather.py.
The quotes are in mp_quotes.py.

Here are some screenshots on how this goes:
